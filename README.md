Thank you for downloading my Snake Game!

A special thanks to Devression for their fantastic tutorial on creating a basic Snake game. I followed their guide and then expanded on the foundation to add my own unique twists.

In this version, the game progressively increases in difficulty, challenging you with faster speeds as you earn points. Once you reach a certain score, the snakeâ€™s colors will change randomly, adding an extra layer of excitement!

I hope you enjoy the game and find it both fun and challenging!
